My name is Marcus Thuresson, I’m 20 years old. I’m from Karlskrona and have lived all my life there. Now I study software engineering in Kalmar at Linnaeus university. I’m currently living in Karlskrona but I’m going to move to Kalmar at the end of December. My interest is mainly cars and computers and a new interest that I have found, programming. I love cars, I own a BMW e39, 5 series and it's one of my dream cars and I am so happy that I already have one of my dream cars at the age of 20. [(here is a picture of my car)](https://mckhaannn.github.io/img/bild2.jpg)  
Computers is an interest I have had since I was a little kid but then it was mainly technology and it still is, but my niche is Computers hardware as software. I really like to build PC's which I have done for all my friends. I also like to play games but not as much now as I did before, before you could have called me a gamer. But I still play games just for the fun of it!
