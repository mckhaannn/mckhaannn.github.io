### How did you implements comments to blog posts?

To implement comments to my site I used a service called Disqus, Disqus makes it possible to have comments on websites and its an easy way to do it, you register an accout on their site and then take the code snippet that Disqus provides to you. I did that and created an html file called **disqus_comments.html** and added the code snippet from Disqus site, then I included the html file in in **post.html**.  
To enable the commentsection to my blogposts i added the tag:  
```
comments: true
```
