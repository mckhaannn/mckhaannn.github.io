### What do you think of static site generatiors?

I have used Jekyll as static site generator on my website! I think that static site generators are good! its easy to setup, and its is dynamic, it's possible to include and separate code from body, footer, header etc. It is even faster and more secure than normal websites! And you can write text in markdown language, which then convert the text to html. This is why static site generators are great to make text based websites as blogs.
