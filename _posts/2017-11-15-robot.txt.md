#### What is robots.txt and how have you configured it for your site?

Robot.txt is a text file that that is located in the root of the website. This file tells search web Robots (also known as Crawlers, Spiders etc.) what content to index for example spammers use this to scan for email addresses. So, when a robot visits a website it first checks the robot.txt to see if it is allowed to enter the website if not it leaves, but there is "bad" robots that scan a website anyways that and ignore that file. I have configured my robot.txt to disallow any robots to index my site.

This is my robot.txt file:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```
